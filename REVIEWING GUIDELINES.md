## Questions to ask when reviewing code:

* Does the code fulfill the requirements of the user story?

* Is the code written in an efficient manner?

* Does this code take the object-oriented programming approach?

* Are the naming conventions of classes, methods, variables etc. chosen with purpose?

* Is the code formatted correctly using the in-built Eclipse code formatter?


_If **all** of the criteria above is met, then the code is fit to be merged_
