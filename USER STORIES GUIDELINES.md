## Structure:

* Who: 
	A user story incorporates the perspective of the person who will use or benefit from the requested feature.	

* What: 
	A user story is a description of the requested feature (or component of a feature) that is short and simple.	
		
* Why: 
	A user story incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team can understand what is driving this particular request.

## Criteria:


### Independent

The user story must be able to stand alone. It must be a feature or a component of a feature that can be 
tested and implemented as a unique element. To the extent possible, user stories should not be dependent on 
other activities. Ideally, they are written so that they can be delivered in any order.

### Negotiable

A user story should invite collaboration and discussion about the best way to solve the business problem 
that is presented. The team, the Scrum master, and the product owner must be open to conversation about 
available options.

### Valuable

Each story adds value. The reason why we do anything in Agile is to drive business value, and the more 
business value being delivered, the higher the priority of the story. If the story does not add business 
value, the team should not work on it (or maybe not consider it).

### Estimatable

Each story is estimatable. The story is not too big or too vague. It is clear enough 
that the developers and testers can reasonably estimate the complexity and length of time to deliver.

### Small

The story should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint or iteration.

### Testable

Is it enough of a feature, and it is written in such a way that it can be tested to make sure it works as 
expected?
